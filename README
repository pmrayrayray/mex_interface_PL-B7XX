Matlab Interface for PL-A8XX/PL-B7XX series cameras (PixeLINK)

This is a MATLAB interface (driver) for PL-A7XX/PL-B7XX series PixeLINK cameras (Firewire). It makes it possible to fully control the openning, closing, parameters setting and image capturing of camera directly with MATLAB.

This work is built on the basis of "MATLAB Interface for Vitana PixeLINK digital camera" that created by M.A.E.Bakker and  L.I.Oei.
"MATLAB Interface for Vitana PixeLINK digital camera" is originally developed only for the PL-A6XX cameras based on the PixeLink SDK 3.1.
I adapted it to support the PL-A7XX/PL-B7XX series cameras by making it workable with PixeLink SDK 4.1.

Development environment: Visual C++ 6.0, Matlab R2006a, PixeLink SDK 4.1.

Remember to link libmx.lib, libmex.lib and PxLAPI40.lib.
